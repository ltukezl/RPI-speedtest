# RPI-speedtest
Rpi Baremetal hobby project.

The original 8-bit counter was beaten and pattern of the game was not completely random.

Motivation is to replace the original cpu and memory unit with raspberry pi to get better randomization,
 
extend the 8 bit counter for longer games and raise the overall difficulty.
